# HemoFinder

**HemoFinder** is a newly introduced tool in **dbAMP 3.0**, designed to predict the **hemolytic activity** and **half-life** of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). This tool assists users in identifying AMPs with better **drug-like potential**, supporting peptide-based drug discovery.

## üß¨ Workflow

HemoFinder follows a structured machine learning pipeline to analyze AMPs.

## üî¨ Features & Methodology

HemoFinder integrates **five widely used peptide descriptors** to capture the sequence and physicochemical characteristics of AMPs:

- **AAC**: Amino Acid Composition  
- **DPC**: Dipeptide Composition  
- **PAAC**: Pseudo Amino Acid Composition  
- **CKSAAGP**: Composition of k-spaced Amino Acid Group Pairs  
- **PHYC**: Physicochemical Properties

These features are fed into a set of **machine learning base learners**, including:

- XGBoost  
- Decision Tree  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Random Forest

The final classifier is built using a **soft voting strategy**, enhancing prediction robustness by leveraging the strengths of each base learner. This ensemble approach allows HemoFinder to **accurately identify peptides with high hemolytic potential**.
